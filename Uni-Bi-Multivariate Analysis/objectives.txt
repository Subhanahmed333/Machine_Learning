30 Analysis Questions for the Insurance Dataset


I. Univariate Analysis (Individual Variables)
What is the average age of the individuals in the dataset?

What is the distribution of BMI? Does it follow a normal distribution (bell curve)?

How many individuals are smokers vs. non-smokers?

What is the most common region represented in the data?

What is the range (Min to Max) of the medical charges?

How many people have zero children?

Are there any outliers in the "Charges" column? (Use a boxplot).

What is the median BMI for the entire group?

Is the Sex variable balanced (roughly 50/50 male/female)?

What is the skewness of the "Charges" variable? (Is it right-skewed?)



II. Bivariate Analysis (Two-Variable Relationships)
Is there a visual correlation between Age and Charges?

Do Smokers pay significantly higher Charges than non-smokers?

How does BMI differ between Males and Females?

Is there a relationship between the number of Children and the total Charges?

Which Region has the highest average medical costs?

Create a scatter plot of BMI vs. Charges: Do you see any distinct "groups" forming?

Does the average Age vary significantly across different Regions?

What is the average BMI of a smoker vs. a non-smoker?

Is there a correlation between Age and BMI?

Do people with more children tend to be older on average?



III. Multivariate Analysis (3+ Variables & Interactions)
Generate a Correlation Heatmap for all numerical variables. Which has the strongest link to charges?

Plot Age vs. Charges and color-code the points by Smoker status. What pattern emerges?

How does the relationship between BMI and Charges change when you account for Smoker status?

Create a "pairplot" for the entire dataset. Which variable pairs show the clearest separation?

What is the average Charge per Region, broken down by Smoker status?

Use a violin plot to show Charges by Children count, split by Sex.

Are older smokers more expensive to insure than younger smokers with higher BMIs?

Create a bubble chart: Age (x-axis), BMI (y-axis), and Charges (size of bubble).

Does the impact of BMI on Charges become more severe after a certain Age?

If you group the data by Region and Sex, which group has the highest median BMI?
